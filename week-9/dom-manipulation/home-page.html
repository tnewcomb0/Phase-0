<!-- Add your reflection here -->

<!-- What did you learn about the DOM?

I learned that it is an alternative to JQuery, albiet a more complicated and less useful alternative. I really didn't learn all that much, it was mostly just looking up syntax and using it.

What are some useful methods to use to manipulate the DOM?

The one we used the most was getElementById. -->
