How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?

The DevTools are a really nice way to work on CSS and see the changes as you make them. You really get to see cause and effect much easier. I also like that you can check and uncheck elements to see if you like one or the other better. It's just a more streamlined, efficient way to get CSS done.

How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?

You resize elements with height and width, using px, %, or em as you unit of measurement. You type the CSS the same way, DOM just gives you a nice template, as well as an auto-complete option.

What are the differences between Absolute, Fixed, Static, and Relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?

-Absolute is where the position depends on its closest positioned other element.
-Fixed is where the element stay in the same spot on your screen, it isn't anchored to the actual webpage. So when you scroll it stays put.
-Static is the default position. It isn't affected by top, right, bottom, and left properties.
-Relative works the same as static unless you add properties, and other elements will not fill in the gap left by its movement.


What are the differences between Margin, Border, and Padding?

Margin is the space between elements, border is the edge of the actual element, and padding is the space between the border and the stuff in the element.

What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)

I really like the DOM, it's nice to get to use something a little more visual. I think it will be more fun to use when I'm more comfortable with CSS, but it is also a great tool to help learn it. I didn't really like not being able to use HTML for this challenge, because a lot of my CSS solutions seemed pretty janky and inelegant.
