          Version control provides many benefits for a user. It keeps your work saved at many different points to allow you to look back at changes you've made previously and see how they've affected your code. If mistakes were made it allows you to go back to a previous version and see where you went wrong, and when working on code that has gone live it allows you to keep working code running while you make changes. It also will keep you from losing massive amounts of work if your machine crashes, since you will be saving your work constantly. There is really nothing more frustrating than losing work and having to redo it all.</article>

    <h2>Blog #2</h2>
      I'm excited to be able to make this website look like something more than some text and links. I have a picture up but I'd like to be able to make it look more polished and welcoming. Right now it works, but that's about the only praise you could give it. I want this to be something I can be proud of.</article>

<!-- What is an html tag?

The html tag is how you wrap your entire webpage. It allows the browser to interpret all the html you wrote. Without it the browser would not know how to read it.

What is a head tag?

The head tag is where you put all the information the browser needs, as well as links to java and CSS to modify your page. The title tag lives here too. For the most part, the head tag is information for the browser and not for the user.

What information should be in the head tag?

You need to include your title tag, a CSS stylesheet link (optional), and your meta character set (UTF-8) so the computer can encode all the charaters you are using.

What purpose does the title tag accomplish?

The title tag gives your webpage a title not on the webpage itself, but in the tab and on the top of your browser window.

What information should live in the body tag?

The body tag denotes where all the actual webpage elements go. So everything the user sees on the actual webpage gets put in here.

What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

I used new HTML tags in this challenge for the most part, other than the very basic ones like body and h1 and h2. This was the first time for me really using the newer HTML tags, before I had been using div and span mostly. But I see myself using article, nav, header, footer, section, and aside quite a bit in the future.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

Elements are laid out according to the tags you use, and they are displayed from top to bottom, left to right unless the tags specify otherwise. By default the will stack on top of each other, with each element taking up the entire width of the page.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

I learned about creating snippets and that the tab key can be quite useful. I certainly think I will be using more snippets as my HTML skills improve. I will want snippets for multiple different elements and styles of page layout.
