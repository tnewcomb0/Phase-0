What is a wireframe?

A wireframe is a very general mock-up of your website. It is similar to an outline for an essay, you are only putting in the structure, not any details.

What are the benefits of wireframing?

The benefits are making sure the site will have a good flow to it. You are able to recognize at this early point how the site will look and feel before all the colors and images and text is put in. If the site looks strange or unintuitive at this point then it will only get worse as it gets more and more added into it.

Did you enjoy wireframing your site?

I can't say I did. I tried 3 different tools and none felt even ok to me. I might have just had bad luck but it took me around 3 hours just to create a basic wireframe and then I had trouble exporting them as well. I hope the links up above work...

Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?

It was revised many times, because I would decide to use elements from the wireframing tools that just wouldn't work, so I would have to start over with a new idea.

What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?

I ended up asking questions from a fellow cohort-er. The online resources didn't help too much, as when I followed their directions it didn't solve the problems I was having. I was having a lot of trouble getting the images to upload correctly.

Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?

I can't say I enjoyed much of this challenge at all. I imagine if I found a tool I liked using and I solved my uploading issues I would have enjoyed this more.
