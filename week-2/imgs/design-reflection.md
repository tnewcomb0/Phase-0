What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?

The 6 phases of web design are: *Information Gathering, Planning, Design, Development, Testing and Delivery, and Maintenence*

What is your site's primary goal or purpose?

My site's goal is to show my growing programming skills and knowledge, as well as provide information about myself to prospective employers down the line.

What kind of content will your site feature?

I will include all my projects throughout DBC and possibly beyond, as well as contact information and links.

What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

My target audience will be other programmers and prospective employers, and as such I want a clean, professional looking site that has engaging content and is easy to navigate.

What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

I will want people to look at my projects for the most part, but I will also have links to different social media if they need to contact me. My main goal is to showcase my successful projects.

What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?

The most important part of design and UX is making sure your site is catering to the audience you want it to. It should be easy to use and create an engaging experience. You will want to tailor it to the users that you anticipate will want to visit it, so if it's a blog about skateboarding you would design it differently than a website for buying antique jewelry. You want the user to have the best experience possible, and as such you want to design it with them in mind.

What is user experience design and why is it valuable?

There were 3 questions in the article What Is User Experience: “Does this website give me value? Is it easy to use? Is it pleasant to use?” These seem to be the core of UX. You want people who visit your site to be who you design around. You don't build your site so you think it looks cool, you build it so the people who are going to be using it enjoy their experience and want to come back. This is valuable because it will encourage users to continue using your site, as well as creating a good experience for them that will prompt them to buy something from you or do whatever your site is intended to do.

Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

I found reading through the UX articles a bit tedious because they seemed to be repeating the same thing often. They seemed to spend a lot of their time justifying UX as a valid discipline and not as much time talking about UX.
