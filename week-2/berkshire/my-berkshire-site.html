- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

It was nice to finally create something that I could show off. There was a few sticking points, but getting through them and figuring them out felt really good.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

The codeacademy section was very helpful as both a teaching material and as a reference. Most of the HTML stuff is straighforward, which is nice because some of the other stuff isn't the same way.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

The main way was to have the navigator keep the driver in check. It also helped that we haven't learned to format much in HTML, so it was hard to avoid.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?

I like that HTML is reasonably straighforward to use, especially since we aren't doing anything stylistic in it. I also like that it is the universal website language, I don't have to learn multiple sets of syntax for it. I don't like that the formatting tools are inferior to CSS, as it would be nice to have HTML be the go-to for formatting as well.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

For now I like to have previous written HTML pages up in the background. If I am having trouble remembering some syntax I can refer back to it to check. I also try to think what it would be based on what I amtrying to do, because often the command is just an abbreviation of what you are doing, like tr is table row for example.
