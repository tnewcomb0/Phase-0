What did you learn about iterating over nested objects in JavaScript?

I learned that you end up with code that can look really messy. It is much more difficult to loop in JavaScript than it is in Ruby.

Were you able to find useful methods to help you with this?

We used ||, the "or" operator, to simplify some of our code.

What concepts were solidified in the process of working through this challenge?

I really understand nested arrays and how to iterate over them better.
