# Reverse Words


# I worked on this challenge by myself.
# This challenge took me [2] hours.

# Pseudocode

# First, I need to split the string into individual words.
# Then, I need to iterate over the array and reverse each word.
# Then, combine all the words back into a sentence.


# Initial Solution

# def reverse_words(str)
#   words = str.split(' ')
#   reverse_string = []

#   words.length.times do |i|
#     reverse_string[i] = words[i].reverse
#   end

#   return reverse_string.join(" ")
# end

# Refactored Solution

# I couldn't find any way to shorten this.

# Reflection

# What concepts did you review or learn in this challenge?

# I reviewed a simple concept to get me back in the flow of using ruby again. It's a little weird changing between languages when you are getting used to one.

# What is still confusing to you about Ruby?

# Sometimes looping in certain ways still confuses me.

# What are you going to study to get more prepared for Phase 1?

# I'm going to do more of the challenges when I get the chance.
