Open source means it is able to be used by anyone in any way. You retain no rights over it.
What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
Open source is wonderful because it allows people to fiddle with someone elses work, and that almost invariably can lead to improvements. For example, the entire MOBA video game genre came from someone fiddling with open source software.

What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
Just the repitition with the git commands was helpful. I would find myself not remembering a command but as I would go to look it up I would usually end up remembering it. I still had some trouble remembering how to pull into github, but that will come with practise.
