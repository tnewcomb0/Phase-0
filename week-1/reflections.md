# 1.1 Think About Time

I looked into 3 different time management and productivity concepts- the Pomodoro Method, the Fogg Method, and meditation. The Pomodoro method is one I have heard works well, working for 25 minutes uninterrupted and then taking a 5 minute break. I’d never heard of the Fogg method, but it seems like sound advice, and it certainly seems like it would be easy to implement. You simply create new habits by adding something very small onto the end of an existing habit, like hanging up your keys on a key hook every time you get home. Last, meditation is something I have limited experience with, but has always seemed like a very effective way of clearing your mind. “Time boxing” is working for a predetermined amount of time towards a goal and taking a break when the time is up, regardless of whether the project is complete or not. I currently do not really have a time management system, I usually just work until I get cranky or tired and then stop, which is certainly something I would love to change. I plan on using all 3 methods to some degree, the Fogg Method as a way to build habits, the Pomodoro method as a way to keep my mind refreshed, and meditation as a way to keep everything in perspective. I plan to use the app Headspace, as I’ve used it a couple times before and found it helped immensely.

# 1.2 The Command Line

A shell is the interface in which you are typing in all of the code. Bash is just the shell you are using. The most challenging thing for me going through all this material is remembering not to be overwhelmed with all the new information. There's a lot of unfamiliar syntax used, and while it was all gone over I don't feel like I have a strong grasp on all of it. However, I realize that this will come with practice and repetition. I was able to use all of the commands, although I was left with a directory in my temp directory I couldn't figure out how to delete, so I must have missed something somewhere. I think the commands are all important, as they are the foundation of all the more complicated commands that will be used in the future. I don't think I could pick one and say that as long as I understand that one the others aren't as important.

pwd- print working directory, it tells you the path to the current directory

ls- list directory, it tells you what the directory contains

mv- move a file or directory, it allows you to move/rename a file or directory into another

cd- change directory, it moves you into another directory

dot dot slash- this moves you up a directory

touch- creates an empty file

mkdir-creates a new directory

less- pages you through a file

rmdir- removes a directory

rm- remove

help- similar to the man command I would assume, not sure what this does off the top of my head

# 1.4 Forking and Cloning

To create a new repository go to github.com and sign in to your profile. Click the "Create New Repository" button. Type in the repository name and make it public. In order to fork a repository you click the "Fork" button while on the page of the repository you want to fork. And last, to clone a repository you go into your terminal and navigate to the directory you want to put the repository in. Then, on the webpage of the repository you want to clone you copy the URL link on the right side. Then, in your terminal, type git clone -paste URL here-

You fork a repository because you want an exact copy of the original one that is connected to the original.

I didn't really have any troubles setting up Git or Github, since the instructions were quite clear. I learned how important and useful version control is and how integral Github will be for my future as a programmer.
