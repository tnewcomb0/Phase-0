def my_hash_deletion_method!(source, thing_to_delete)
  source.delete_if { |k| k == thing_to_delete }
  p source
end

# Identify and describe the Ruby method(s) you implemented.
# For the array method I used delete_if? and .include?. Delete_if uses a block
# to determine what should be removed from the array, and in that block I turned all
# the elements to strings so they could be checked and then used .include to check all
# the strings for the offending character and let the method know which ones to remove.
# For the hash method I also used delete_if. This one was simpler because the block was
# just comparing the key in the hash to the one passed to it.
# I want to note that I told it to p source because these methods are destructive, so the
# array and hash would be permanently altered, but by themselves the methods return the '
# deleted value, so you have to specify that you want the method to return the result of
# deleting the value instead.

# 2. Teach your accountability group how to use the methods
#   Both of the methods I created were fairly similar in that they both relied on the .select
#   method in order to return the information I needed in the correct format. They differ in
#   the format they return information -- array.select returns an array of the elements that
#   meet the conditions you specify (in this case, it returns an array with words that include
#   the thing to find). hash.select, however, returns a hash with the key/value pairs that meet
#   the condition you specify (in this case, it will return pairs with values that equal the
#   thing to find). In order to return ONLY the keys in the form of an array, .keys was utilized.

# 3. Share any tricks you used to find and decipher the Ruby Docs
#   Oh man, to be honest what helps me intially is to control-f keywords that I know will help
#   me find any relevant methods. So I found .select by searching for the keyword "contain"
#   because I figured that would help me find a method that searches through data containing x.
#   Also, if I want the method to return something specific, I would search for that. So for the
#   hash method I knew that I wanted the output to be an array of keys, so I searched "array" in
#   the hash docs and .keys was one of the only methods that came up which worked perfectly!

#   What did you learn about researching and explaining your research to others?
#   I learned that the best way to parse Ruby Docs is to really know what kind of method you need
#   by looking for it in another way, like stack overflow, and then instead of looking at answers people
#   have posted, just take away some recommended methods to use and try them out to see how they work,
#   using Ruby Docs as a guideline.

# Person 4: Malia Lehrer

# Release 2: Teach Others

# 1. Identify and describe the Ruby method(s) you implemented.
#   The methods that I used were delete_if, to_s, and .include for the array,
#   and delete_if for hashes. Delete_if uses a block to determine what to remove
#   from the source. The block that I passed to delete_if for the array turned all
#   the elements into strings (nondestructively) using to_s, because the .include
#   method can be used with strings but not with integers. .include checks to see which
#   strings include the string passed to it. Delete_if will then remove the strings that
#   .include finds. For the hash, I used the block to compare each key in the hash to the
#   key that needed to be removed. Delete_if then removes the ones that return true.

#   To get the required result from both of these methods I had to make sure to specify
#   what the method was returning. Delete_if is destructive, so it will permanently alter
#   the source, but it won't return the source unless you it to. Instead, it returns the
#   deleted value, which is not what we want.

# 2. Teach your accountability group how to use the methods
#   .delete_if can be called on any hash or array. It takes a block, so the full thing looks like:
#       source.delete_if #{|key_or_element| key_or_element.does_or_is_this_thing}
#   It should be kept in mind what I mentioned above: delete_if will remove what you want it to
#   remove, but then it returns that, so make sure to specify that you want the changed array removed.

# 3. Share any tricks you used to find and decipher the Ruby Docs
#   I'm a ctrl+f'er, too, Shawn! I'll go into the section I know I need to look through and then
#   search for keywords. I usually have an idea of how ruby "talks" so sometimes I can land on the
#   method just by searching for what I want it to do. That was how I found include right away.

#   #partition -- makes two arrays from one, placing elements that satisfy boolean into

# #is_a? -- tests whether the object is a member of a specific class

# 2. Teach your accountability group how to use the methods
# #partition works elegantly to separate a set of values into two arrays.
#   All you need it a boolean to sort by and use the familiar {|element| expression}
#   that we've seen with #map/#collect.  So array.partition {|element| boolean}
# #to_a turns a hash into an array with each key/value combination an element in the array.
# #is_a?  Trevor doesn't need to be told about #is_a since I borrowed it from him!
#   You just put a class name after it: object_name.is_a?(Class_name).
#   Note that Class_name is capitalized and not in quotes.  This threw me off.

# 3. Share any tricks you used to find and decipher the Ruby Docs
# I really just browse them.  Each time I see more methods than I'll actually use
# to solve the current problem, and that means I might remember those methods the
# next time. So often I do think "I think I saw a method that might do this..."
# I'm also curious about what version of Ruby Docs is the "right" one given
# Coderpad is running 2.2.3 and my laptop, following the DBC instructions, is running 2.2.1
