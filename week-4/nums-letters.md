What is an integer? What is a float?

An integer is a number without a decimal place, and a float (or floating point number) is a number with a decimal place.

What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

Float division is just like regular division, in that it returns the exact answer, donw to the decimal value. Integer division, however, returns only integet values, so no numbers with decimal points. So it will round down any integer value in the answer.
